## SkyPulse: A Rocket-Smart Autonomous Control System  

Welcome to **SkyPulse**, your chance to play rocket scientist without the rocket fuel. This project is inspired by **SpaceX's Falcon 9**—those sleek beasts that land themselves like magic but actually run on incredibly complex, fault-tolerant software. SkyPulse is here to emulate that brilliance on your desktop. Think redundant loops, fault injection, and telemetry dashboards, all while being 100% testable and open for your tinkering pleasure.  

---

### **Why SkyPulse Exists**  
Watching Falcon 9 launches, one thing becomes clear: the stakes are high, the math is relentless, and the software? It needs to be perfect. What happens when the main control system glitches mid-flight? A backup takes over, seamlessly. This got us thinking: why not build something that mimics this logic?  

SkyPulse is your playground to understand:  
1. **How rockets stay upright during flight and landing.**  
2. **How to write software that doesn't panic under pressure.**  
3. **How to simulate chaos and recover like a boss.**

---

### **Project Anatomy**  

SkyPulse is split into key components, each designed to replicate core rocket software concepts. Here's the breakdown:

---

#### **1. Redundant Control Loops**  
> _“If one fails, the other prevails.”_

This is the brain of SkyPulse. It has two loops:  
- **Primary Loop:** Handles all flight commands until something bad happens.  
- **Backup Loop:** Quietly monitors the primary loop, ready to jump in when it falters.

##### **How It Works**  
- The primary loop runs on a 100ms timer, issuing flight commands like a metronome.  
- If the primary loop fails (or if we simulate a failure), the backup loop takes over within milliseconds.  
- A **Failover Manager** handles the switch with zero disruption.  

##### **Why It’s Cool**  
- This is how rockets handle life-or-death decisions.  
- It teaches you how to build systems that prioritize reliability over raw speed.  

---

#### **2. Fault Injection**  
> _“What if everything that could go wrong, did?”_

This module lets you simulate chaos. Want to see what happens when the primary loop throws a tantrum? Inject a fault.  

##### **Fault Types**  
- **Transient Faults:** Temporary issues that resolve on their own (like a cosmic sneeze).  
- **Persistent Faults:** Long-lasting problems that force a failover.  
- **Cascading Faults:** A domino effect of failures.  

##### **How It Works**  
- Faults can be injected manually via the CLI or randomly at runtime.  
- The system logs each fault, so you can study the aftermath.  

##### **Why It’s Cool**  
- SpaceX runs exhaustive fault simulations before every launch. Now, you can too.  

---

#### **3. Performance Metrics**  
> _“Measure what matters.”_

SkyPulse doesn’t just recover from failures; it tells you how well it did.  

##### **Metrics Tracked**  
- **Recovery Time:** How quickly the system switches to the backup loop.  
- **Latency:** The delay between command execution and feedback.  
- **System Load:** How much CPU power is being chewed up.  

##### **Why It’s Cool**  
- Performance engineering is rocket science’s secret sauce.  
- These metrics help you optimize for real-world reliability.  

---

#### **4. CLI Interface**  
> _“Talk to your rocket, like a pro.”_

No one wants to dig through code to test features. That’s why SkyPulse comes with a fully interactive CLI.  

##### **Commands**  
- `start`: Launch the simulation.  
- `inject`: Trigger a fault (choose your chaos).  
- `metrics`: View real-time performance stats.  

##### **Why It’s Cool**  
- It makes the system accessible to anyone, even non-developers.  
- The CLI is expandable, so you can add your own commands.  

---

#### **5. Real-Time Telemetry Dashboard**  
> _“Houston, we have visuals.”_

Because numbers on a screen are boring, SkyPulse includes a WebSocket-powered dashboard. It shows:  
- Control loop status (Primary or Backup).  
- Current metrics (latency, recovery time).  
- A live feed of fault injections and responses.  

##### **Why It’s Cool**  
- This is how mission control monitors rockets.  
- It’s a great intro to real-time data visualization.  

---

#### **6. Expandability**  
> _“Dream big, code bigger.”_

SkyPulse is modular, meaning you can add features without breaking existing functionality. Some ideas:  
- **Add more loops:** Why stop at two? Triple redundancy, anyone?  
- **Introduce new faults:** Simulate things like hardware degradation or software bugs.  
- **Integrate machine learning:** Predict faults before they happen.

### **Motivations**  

Building SkyPulse was a mix of admiration and curiosity. Watching SpaceX rockets land with robotic precision made us wonder:  
- What happens when things go wrong?  
- How do systems handle failure autonomously?  
- Could we build a tiny piece of that magic with code?

SkyPulse is the answer. It’s not just a simulator; it’s a way to think like a rocket engineer.

SkyPulse is more than code—it’s a mindset. Starting small, thinking big, and aiming for the stars.  

Well, it is basically fictitious on assumptions.
